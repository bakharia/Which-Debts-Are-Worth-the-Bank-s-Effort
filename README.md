# Which-Debts-Are-Worth-the-Bank-s-Effort

After a debt has been legally declared "uncollectable" by a bank, the account is considered to be "charged-off." But that doesn't mean the bank simply walks away
from the debt. They still want to collect some of the money they are owed. In this project, you will look at a situation where a bank assigned delinquent customers 
to different recovery strategies based on the expected amount the bank believed it would recover from the customer. The goal for the data scientist is to determine 
in this non-random assignment whether the incremental amount the bank earns exceeded the additional cost of assigning customers to a higher recovery strategy.
